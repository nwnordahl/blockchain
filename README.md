## Preface

The modern day financial system relies on peoples trust of big centralized banks to hold our fiat currencies and execute transactions. [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) (first described by [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) in a [white paper from 2008](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)) was the first software to solve this problem by moving the trust over to cryptographic proof, and the need for a "middle man" was removed.

## How it works

The technology/protocol that makes Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies like [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/), [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/), etc.) work is called blockchain. The blockchain contains all the transactions that has been made, and this blockchain is shared and synchronized all over the world.
